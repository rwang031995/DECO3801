# Plants vs Cars

As the population of the world continues to rise, so too do the number of people living in cities. In 2018, 55% of the world’s population lived in urban areas, and is projected to increase to 68% by 2050. These rapidly growing city populations pose a serious problem to productivity, human health, environmental health, and economic sustainability through traffic congestion alone. For example, in 2016, traffic congestion was found to cost the Australian economy $18.9 billion in 2016, with a projected increase to $38.8 billion per year by 2031. One solution is to encourage the use of public transportation over personal vehicles. 

The project goal is to design a mobile-based game, “Plants vs. Cars”, that will encourage users to transition from travelling using private transport to travelling using public and active transport. The game will provide consistent challenges with either informative quizzes or personalized tasks according to users’ transportation pattern to promote a transport pattern shift.  

Progress in the game will be represented through a garden/forest metaphor: challenges completed will allow the user to upgrade their personal in-game garden, and in aggregate (at the suburb level) with a forest, or (perhaps) a collection of gardens. Building on the social side, the game will also utilize social competitiveness to further entice users to persist with weekly challenges.
